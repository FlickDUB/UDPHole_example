UDPHole_example
===============

Simple example of UDP hole punching in python.

##Usage
This has a 'client' and a 'server'. They each need to know eachother's IP address and port to connect on,
which are hardcoded in the clientAddr and serverAddr variables. Then they exchange some data and that's it.
